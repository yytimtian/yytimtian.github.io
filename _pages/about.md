I am a PhD candidate in mathematics, working under the supervision of Eric Cytrynbaum and Colin Macdonald.
My research is in applied mathematics; mathematical biology. I am broadly interested in applying computational and mathematical tools in the modelling of biological systems. My current work involves mechanistic models of the plant cell cytoskeleton: the organization of plant cortical microtubules. [Click here for an intro to plant cortical mictrotubules (CMTs)](/research/). This project involves a fun combination of differential equations, geometry, stochastic processes, and scientific computing.

Before this, I completed:
- M.Sc. in mathematics, The University of British Columbia (2020-2022)
- B.Sc. in mathematics and physics, University of Toronto (2016-2020)
    * Mathematics and Physics Specialist

Outside of research, I am on a lifelong quest to find a fruiting pawpaw tree (<i>Asimina triloba</i>) -- let me know if you have any leads! I am a big fan of plants in general (not just in theory). It's more of a coincidence that my research involves plants. Fungi are also cool; I'm similarly on the lookout for chanterelles.
